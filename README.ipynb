    "According to the [Mayo Clinic Website](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204#:~:text=Pneumonia%20is%20an%20infection%20that,and%20fungi%2C%20can%20cause%20pneumonia.), \"Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia. Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems.\" \n",

    "The x-ray images used for this analysis were obtained from Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, Guangzhou, China. These x-rays were obtained from pediatric patients ranging from the ages one to five as part of their normal routine care. All images that were of low quality or unreadable were removed and were reviews by three expert physicians for the purpose of AI analysis.\n",

In total there are 5,863 X-Ray images. The dataset was downloaded from the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)."

I used classification reports for the models to give me accuracy, loss, recall, precision, and F1 score metrics. I also built a pretrained VGG16 CNN to classify the X-Ray Images. You can learn more about VGG16 classification and detection [here](https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/)."
